    9/26/2019:
    
    - Added README that explains most of the basic goals as well as what is currently finished
    
    - A few minor fixes and commenting added
    
    __________________________________________
    
    Next up is to work on the actual data structure(s) that will hold the user(s)' logged data for each boss.
    
    As stated in the README it will be possible to have multiple logs for each boss.
    
    Each sub-log and main log for each boss will include:
    -Totals for kills, time spent, loot value, and unique/rare drops.
    -Calculated values for kills/hour, loot value/kill, and loot value/hour.
    
    ie The boss monster Nex for user 'Zach':
    
    Zach can create a log for Nex called "Range Setup" as well as a separate log also for Nex called "Melee Setup".  Zach can then add data from hours of gameplay to one of the logs.  This enables Zach to view and compare average stats for each log as well as still view the total numbers for kills, time spent, and loot value at Nex added up from each unique log.
    
    This data will be stored in the PersistentDataPath so it is not changed or deleted upon Application updates or patches, and will be saved to a .dat file using BinaryFormatter.
