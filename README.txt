9/26/2019 - Zach Mitchell - RS3 Bossing Log Tool

* First, there are two tools being utilized by this program created by others.  These are:

-  Google Sheets script by /u/zenyl on reddit.  This allows me to keep auto-updated google sheets that pulls pricing data from the game

-  Google Sheets to Unity (GSTU) (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/google-sheets-to-unity-73410).  This allows me to read aforementioned data into a Unity application.

So, a huge thanks to those two for their publicly available code.

_________________________________________________________________

The goal of this tool is to enable tracking and calculation in regards to PvM within RuneScape.

Bossing Log Features:

1)  Log(s) for each boss within the game to track average kills, average loot, kill/hour, etc as well as the number of unique/rare drops.  Each boss may have multiple logs in case you wish to experiment with multiple setups to compare.  Stats will be available for each individual boss log as well as for that boss in general.

2)  A calculator with current item and price data for your selected boss in order to track your total loot value.  This can then be used to update the data on your desired log for said boss.  You could also simply enter a total value of your own, but this will not track unique drops.
	
3)  A gear and setup calculator where you can choose what armour, weapons, potions, etc. you are using in order to calculate how much gold you are using per hour with your setup.

*HOW TO USE THIS TOOL*

-This will be updated as features are implemented


Drops Tab:

1) Select your boss
2) Select the item you received
3) Enter the number of this item you received
4) Click add to add this to your drop list which appears in the center of the screen
5) Repeat steps 2-4 until all your drops have been added. You may remove an incorrect item by left clicking on that item box within the list and clicking "Remove"
6a) Once you have added all your drops, you can either select an existing log from the dropdown, or create a new log.
6b) If you click "Add New Log", you will be prompted to enter a name that is not a duplicate of one already existing for that boss.
	

- There is a timer if you wish to keep track of your trip length via this app.
- There is also a killcount area to track your total kills if you wish by clicking the "Add Kill" button each time you finish a kill.

Logs Tab:

1) Select a boss
2) Select a log
3) All data about that boss should be shown to the right - totals from each log from the boss added up as well as the individual log you selected.
